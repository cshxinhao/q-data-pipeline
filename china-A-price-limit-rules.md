# A-Share Price Limit Rules

> **Note for Implementation:**  
> 1. **Priority Logic:** When validating data, evaluate rules in order. **IPO-specific rules** take precedence over **Normal Trading rules** if the stock is in its initial listing phase.  
> 2. **Date Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD`.  
> 3. **Price Limit:** Represented as a decimal (e.g., `0.10` = 10%). `None` indicates no hard limit (but temporary suspension mechanisms may apply).  
> 4. **Context:** Current date is assumed to be **2026**. Historical rule changes are reflected accordingly.
